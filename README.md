# Parallel K-Means Data Clustering

This repository is about to create a CUDA implementation of the KMeans algorithm. Instead of implementing a sequential KMeans algorithm from scratch, we decided to make use of the open source implementation provided by [Wei-keng Liao](http://users.ece.northwestern.edu/~wkliao/Kmeans/index.html) so that we can be more focused on the CUDA implementation.
